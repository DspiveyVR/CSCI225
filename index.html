        <p>
            My name is Denton Spivey. I'm currently in my junior year and majoring in Software engineering.
            I've been programming for several years and have spent many hours coding for personal projects before
            attending college. My primary areas of interest are compilers and programming language design, as well
            as computer organization and architecture. Aside from programming, I also make experimental electronic
            music as a hobby and have been doing so for about 5 years.

                <p>
                    My most complex project by far is a C compiler I wrote from scratch in C, with the intent to someday
                    advance it to the point that it can compile itself. I'm not sure if it will ever reach that state
                    since
                    its current capabilities are nowhere even close to accomplishing this goal and I've already spent a
                    ton of time on it.
                    Though I do think the goal is feasible as long as I stay committed to the project for a few more
                    years.

                <p>
                    When I took Discrete Math for Computer Science we had some homework assignments where we had to draw
                    the truth table
                    for a given logical expression (such as. p v ~q) and I did not want to go through the tedious
                    process of calculating
                    the truth tables myself so I wrote a program in Rust to do it for me. This probably didn't save me
                    any time but it was
                    fun.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's some of my weird music. This song's genre is called "melodic extratone." Extratone is an
                    extreme subgenre of
                    electronic music where distorted kickdrums are played at such a speed that it creates a tone. This
                    effect can be
                    heard at 3:05 in the song. The bassline that you hear is actually just kickdrums played at over 2000
                    bpm. This song
                    is actually a pretty tame example of this genre. Extratone songs are usually more harsh and far less
                    melodic. For an
                    example of that you can listen to <a
                        href="https://extratoneregeneration.bandcamp.com/track/nausea">nausea</a>, which
                    is another one of my songs (that I released under a different alias) and it is heavily inspired
                    by extreme forms of metal music.
